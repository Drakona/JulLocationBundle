This bundle is in development. You may try it in a dev environment, but tests have not been written for it yet.

You are using this bundle at your own risks!

Full documentation and tests are expected mid 02-2013

JulLocationBundle provides 4 location entities configured to avoid duplicates:

1. `Location`
2. `City`
3. `State`
4. `Country`

You can use as little as the `Country` entity, or as much as the full precision
`Location` entity, and everything in between.

In addition, a Googlemap places autocomplete implementation can be activated 
to feed the entities with properly formatted data, show the location on a map,
and even offer photos of the locations when available.
